# PasswordVaultProject

# Project parameters:

# Your code must follow the UML diagram (this helps prevent simply copying a solution from the web).
# Your code should store the passwords in a file in encrypted form. 
# Your code should allow for displaying current password(s), inserting new passwords, updating passwords, and deleting passwords.
# Each password entry should allow for three fields: Name of what the password goes to (i.e.- Gmail, School login, Discord, Instagram, etc.), the Username, and the Password.
# Your password vault should allow for 20 password entries.
